                    <p>
                        I’m a French student located in Paris, and currently I’m in 2nd year on 5 at the IIM, school of digital defense. 
                        Having always been attracted to new technologies, it was natural for me that my future job is related to this universe.</br></br>
                        I’m pretty well organized and involved in my projects, I don’t do things half way. 
                        I am a sports fada, I also like when I have time to read manga and watch anime, series… (GOT > ALL). 
                        But what I love most of all is the mountain, which is why on my projects you can find a multitude of references to the latter.</br></br>
                        I am a fairly solitary person, but strangely when it comes to making projects I prefer to be in a group. 
                        Alone we go faster, together we go further
